# HANGMAN
View the live project here 

Hangman is a classic word game. This game is a fun way of learning vocabulary, and it's especially useful for remembering the spelling of new words.  

The website's goal is to provide a challenging, educational game to entertain the online user. 

Hangman's target is adults looking for a short game with no long-term commitments, something familiar that brings back memories of the good old days, and young adults keen to learn new words in a fun way.

- This section appears when the user types its first guessed letter, and it keeps adding each letter typed.
- This part is a reminder of the letters typed, and it helps the user to proceed with the game without making the same mistakes.

### The Hangman
<img src="readme-images/hangman.png">

- This section changes the background every time the user types the wrong letter building the "hangman"; when the hangman is complete, the game is over, and the user loses. However, if the user guesses the word before then, it will display the victory background image.
- From this feature, the user can see how close he/she is to lose the game.

### The Score

- The score will update every time the game is over: if the user wins, the score under the happy face will increase by 1; if the user loses, the score under the sad face will increase by 1.
- From this feature, the user can see how many games have been lost or won.

### The Underscores

- This section generates every time the game is loaded. Every underscore represents a letter of the chosen word. When the user guesses the correct letter, it gets displayed in the respective space.
- From this feature, the user can see how long the word is and, through correct guessings,  the letter's position. This section helps the user to win the game.

### The Final Message
<img src="readme-images/final-message.png">

- This section pops up when the game is over. If the user wins, it shows a message of congratulations, otherwise of encouragement. Either way, below the statement, it displays the secret word, its definition, and the "play again!" button.
- This section acknowledges the user of the game's result and enriches the user's vocabulary by defining the meaning of the word that could have been previously unknown. 

### The "Play Again!" Button

It resets the hangman, the input section, and along with the word, it updates the underscore section.
- This button is displayed when the game is over and allows the user to play again.
